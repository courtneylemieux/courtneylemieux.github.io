<p><b>For my BUS 220 class, I have decided to do my website on all my favorite things.</b></p>




<p>While there are many things I love to do, I've decided to choose three of them to put on my website!
    I love spending time with my family and friends, I love pets, and I am a coffee connoissuer.
